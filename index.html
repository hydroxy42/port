            <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
            <p> As a third-year engineering student based in Hyderabad, I am deeply passionate about the fields of machine learning and computer vision. I have actively engaged in both academic pursuits and extracurricular responsibilities, seeking to integrate these interests into my education.
                Serving as the Second-in-Command of the Public Relations Committee in my college, I have honed my communication and leadership skills, facilitating effective communication between various stakeholders. This experience has not only sharpened my interpersonal abilities but also taught me the importance of clear and concise messaging.
                In addition to my role in public relations, I proudly lead my college's football team as its captain. This responsibility has not only enabled me to cultivate teamwork and sportsmanship among my peers but also instilled in me a deep sense of discipline and dedication.
                Beyond my academic and leadership commitments, I am an avid enthusiast of games, sports, and travel. These hobbies have allowed me to unwind, while also providing opportunities for personal growth and cultural exposure.
                The intersection of my academic pursuits and personal interests culminate in my fervor for machine learning and computer vision. Exploring the potential of these fields not only excites me but also reflects my dedication to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.
                Overall, my experiences as a college student have equipped me with a diverse skill set, from effective communication and leadership to teamwork and time management. I look forward to applying these skills in my future endeavors, both within the academic realm and in my professional career, with a particular focus on advancing the frontiers of machine learning and computer vision.</p>
